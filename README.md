# Enhanced-Umbilical : 
A reinforced plate based on the umbilical board
## Improved feature description
1. Maintain original umbilical cord function
2. The input voltage is 24V
3. Provides two-wire (VCC & GND)/three-wire (VCC & GND & PWM) fan conversion to adapt to different control methods
4. Fan voltage can be selected from 5/12/24V to adapt to different fan voltages
5. Provides an additional set of inputs to control four sets of auxiliary cooling fans

## other instructions
1. When using two-wire mode: \
     +Vs connects to the positive pole of the fan -s connects to the negative pole of the fan
2. When using three-wire mode: \
     +Vs is connected to the positive pole of the fan, -S is connected to the fan PWM, and GND is connected to the negative pole of the fan.
3. Please use a variable resistor to adjust the voltage to 12V when using it for the first time.
